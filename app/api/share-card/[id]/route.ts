// Placeholder file moved here to avoid accidental route exports.
// Do NOT export any handlers from this file; the real route handler
// lives in `route.tsx`.

// No exports below — this file is intentionally inert.

// Make this file an explicit module so TypeScript treats imports
// of `route.js` as a module during type generation.
